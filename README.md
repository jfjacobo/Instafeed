### App Description
This application is based on the services provided by Google Maps to rate a restaurant, based on the user rating, a description of how the experience was, if the user decided to enter it, and at the same time a space to add an optional picture about the restaurant, menu, food, etc.
The application implements a database helper to store all restaurant information, allows navigation between pages, and saves new data entered by the user with shared preferences. It's a suitable app for users who want to check a quick restaurant review before they go so they have an idea of what to expect.
